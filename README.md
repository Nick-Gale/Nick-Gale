I am a scientist from Perth, Australia 🦘. Currently finishing my PhD with Stephen Eglen (@sje30) at the University of Cambridge focusing on the theoretical aspects of topographic map development.

## 📜 Research
 \#mathematics \#datascience \#neuroscience 

1. Theoretical and mathematical aspects of neuroscience
2. Modelling development of topographic maps (esp. superior colliculus in mice)
3. Optimisation and learning problems 

## 💻 Current
My current work is using principles of topographic map development to further develop a Travelling Salesman Problem heuristic. Here it is solving a problem to draw the Mona Lisa with 100k nodes.
