I am a scientist from Perth, Australia 🦘. Currently finishing my PhD with Stephen Eglen at the University of Cambridge focusing on the theoretical aspects of topographic map development.

## Research
 \#mathematics \#datascience \#neuroscience 

I study theoretical aspects of neuroscience. My research has mainly been focused on the development of topographic maps. These are cool brain structures that pop up every and have a stereotypical relationship: neighbours map to neighbours. They are the brains continous maps, in some sense! I also like thinking about how these principles can be abstracted. 

## Current
My current work is using these principles to further develop a Travelling Salesman Problem heuristic. Here it is solving a problem to draw the Mona Lisa with 100k nodes.
